# Wqsknijper
I am Wqsknijper, feel free to call me Sammie. (Yet still not my irl name)

## Currently working on
There's a few projects I am **currently** working on. Here's a list:
 - **PRIVATE CODE** Nidocraft Network, 1.12+ FFA/Training Minecraft server. play.nidocraft.net on Minecraft Java.
 - **PRIVATE CODE** ~~Private name~~, a school project of a grocery webshop developed using SolidJS and with an API writtin in Javascript using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
 - **PRIVATE CODE** ~~Private name~~, a school project of a schedule application based off of our school systems. (Zermelo, SOMToday and It'sLearning)
 - Matchplaats, a school project but used as portfolio project as well. An attempt to a full stack dating application available for both phone and web. Not planned for commercial use.

## Worked on previously
I do not have any previous projects worth mentioning. Nidocraft takes a lot of time and has a few different Minecraft plugins I am developing myself.
However, I am planning on developing portfolio projects after my final exams.
